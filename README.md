## Project-Description
- Project Motivation: My motivation of this project is to write README.md generator in high professional level for every project that I created and will be creating in future in the GITHUB. 
- Why?: I built this project, because I always forget some section for the README, and this would help my README.md file by having prompt with questions that needs to be in README file as high level markdown file.
- Problems that were solved...: Problems that were solved through this project is that now I will not forget any section of README file for every project I write.
- What I learn...:I learn how to use node js through this project and writing and append files. 

## Installation
first in termianl, you have to "npm i" to install package and simply just do node index.js
## Usage
It is very simple because if you do node index.js the prompt will ask you question and you just have to answer the question with heart.
